# sandwich/prep

You are running the `prep` pipeline. Your job: produce prioritization data that helps humans decide what to build next.

## When to invoke

- User runs `/prep`
- User asks "what should we build first" / "apa yang harus dikerjakan dulu"
- User has a brief and wants to start implementation
- User wants to understand the impact of a specific feature

## What it produces

Output is split into the **committed registry** (the source of truth) and
**committed views** (shareable projections in `docs/sandwich/`). A `.sandwich/.gitignore` is
written automatically to keep machine state hidden.

**Committed — `.sandwich/registry/`:**

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `project.json` | Project metadata, brief hashes, gate states |
| `features.json` | Canonical feature ledger — stable IDs, lifecycle, scores, human overrides, spec links, commits |
| `questions.json` | Client questions ↔ answers ↔ what they unblock |
| `decisions.json` | ADR-lite scope/architecture decisions |
| `journal.jsonl` | Append-only audit trail of every change |

**Committed views — rendered each run to `docs/sandwich/`:**

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `feature-queue.md` | Human-readable projection of the registry (shareable with PMs) |
| `specs/F-XXX.md` + `specs/F-XXX.json` | Per-feature spec: scope + acceptance-criteria checklist — the dev's starting point for Superpowers brainstorming |

**Git-ignored (machine state):**

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.sandwich/impact-analysis.md` | Deep dive on a specific feature (on demand) |
| `.sandwich/.plan-context.json` | Validation/debug context |

Feature identity is stable: a feature keeps its ID (and its spec, commits, and
human overrides) across re-runs even if the brief rewore its title, because
matching is by content fingerprint — never by position or exact text.

## Pipeline

1. **Read brief artifacts** — prd.md, user-flows.md, technical-notes.md, client-questions.md

2. **Validate brief** — check completeness, warn if critical artifacts missing

3. **Extract features** — parse all features with validation + retry (max 3 attempts)

4. **Check confidence** — if confidence < 0.4, block and require human review

5. **Reconcile** — if brief changed, merge with existing queue (preserve in-progress work)

6. **Analyze dependencies** — build dependency graph with validation

7. **Score features** — the agent supplies four dimension scores (impact, effort, risk, urgency); code computes the priority deterministically as `(impact × urgency × (10 − risk)) ÷ effort`, normalized to 0-100. The model never supplies the number, so the ranking is always reproducible.

8. **Write registry files** — write `features.json`, `project.json`, `questions.json`, `decisions.json`, and append to `journal.jsonl`. The pi-gate validates each write against the schema; if validation fails it prints the exact errors — fix the field and retry. For every feature that gets a spec in step 9, set its `specRef` to `"specs/F-XXX.json"` so drift detection can flag stale specs when the brief moves.

9. **Write per-feature specs** — for EVERY active feature (lifecycle not `done`/`rejected`), write `docs/sandwich/specs/F-XXX.json` following the spec schema below. Derive scope and acceptance criteria from the brief only — do NOT invent task breakdowns, estimates, or file lists (that is Superpowers brainstorming's job).

10. **Run the deterministic renderers** — after all registry and spec files are written, run both:
    ```bash
    node --experimental-strip-types $SANDWICH_ROOT/prep/scripts/render.ts
    node --experimental-strip-types $SANDWICH_ROOT/prep/scripts/render-specs.ts
    ```
    `SANDWICH_ROOT` is injected into your context at session start. The scripts read the registry and spec JSONs, render `docs/sandwich/feature-queue.md` and `docs/sandwich/specs/F-XXX.md`, and exit 1 with exact errors if anything is invalid. Fix and re-run.

11. **Verify completeness** — run:
    ```bash
    node --experimental-strip-types $SANDWICH_ROOT/prep/scripts/verify-complete.ts
    ```
    Exit 1 lists every missing or invalid artifact (a feature without a spec, a journal decision missing from decisions.json, a missing rendered file). Fix each listed item and re-run until it prints `✓ /prep output is complete`. /prep is NOT done until this passes.

12. **Present recommendation** — top 3 candidates with validation status, and point the human at the top feature's spec file: "buka `docs/sandwich/specs/F-XXX.md` untuk mulai".

## Validation layer

Every agent output passes through:

1. **Schema validation** — zod schema catches format errors
2. **Retry with repair** — on validation failure, agent retries with error message
3. **Confidence scoring** — based on confidence markers in features
4. **Threshold blocking** — low confidence (< 0.4) blocks execution

```
Agent output → JSON parse → Schema validate → Confidence check
                    ↓              ↓                ↓
              malformed?      invalid?          too low?
                    ↓              ↓                ↓
               retry (3x)     retry (3x)       block + warn
```

**Confidence weights:**
- `[stated]` = 1.0
- `[discussed]` = 0.8
- `[inferred]` = 0.5
- `[assumed]` = 0.2

**Blocking thresholds:**
- Average confidence < 0.4 → block
- > 30% assumed features → block

## Commands

| Command | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| `/prep` | Smart: reconcile if brief changed, else use existing queue |
| `/prep --fresh` | Force re-extraction, ignore existing queue |
| `/prep [feature-id]` | Deep impact analysis for specific feature |
| `/prep --impact-only [feature-id]` | Skip prioritization, just analyze impact |
| `/prep --queue-only` | Update queue without recommendation |
| `/prep --approve` | Pass the `queueApproved` gate — confirms scores/overrides/removals |
| `/prep --done F-XXX [commit-sha...]` | Mark a feature done, recording any commit SHAs |

## Key principles

1. **Human decides, AI analyzes** — provide data, not orders
2. **Unblocking is high value** — features that enable others score higher
3. **Confidence matters** — `[assumed]` features flagged for validation
4. **Execution state aware** — if F-001 is already in progress, don't recommend it
5. **Brief is source of truth** — never invent features not in brief
6. **Preserves in-progress work** — reconciliation never auto-removes active features

## Reconciliation behavior

When brief changes after initial `/prep`:

```
/order --refine → brief artifacts update
        ↓
/prep → detects brief change
        ↓
    Reconciles:
      • New features → add to queue
      • Removed features → flag for review (preserve if in-progress)
      • Changed features → mark "needs-reanalysis"
        ↓
    Output: "3 added, 1 removed, 2 affected"
```

### Removal actions

| Status | Action |
|--------|--------|
| in-progress | `preserve_and_flag` — never auto-remove active work |
| done | `keep_as_history` — preserve completed features |
| queued | `flag_for_review` — ask human to confirm removal |

## Relationship to other ingredients

```
/order → /prep → User picks → Superpowers brainstorming → execution
           │
           └─→ feature-queue.md (execution state)
```

The feature queue is committed to `docs/sandwich/` — shareable with PMs. It can be regenerated at any time from the registry.

## Registry file schemas (MANDATORY)

**These are exact schemas. Use these field names and types precisely.**
**Do NOT invent field names. Do NOT wrap arrays in objects.**

> **A deterministic gate validates every registry write.** Writes to
> `.sandwich/registry/*` are checked against these schemas in code before they
> land: the priority number is recomputed from your dimension scores (you never
> set it), recoverable mistakes are auto-corrected, and anything that can't be
> validated is rejected with the exact errors to fix. Follow the schema and the
> write succeeds on the first try.

Registry files go in `.sandwich/registry/`. Create the directory if it doesn't exist.

### docs/sandwich/specs/F-XXX.json — one file per active feature

> Validated by `render-specs.ts` and `verify-complete.ts`. Content only —
> never include priority, lifecycle, estimates, task lists, or file paths.

```json
{
  "featureId": "F-001",
  "title": "OTP Verification Flow",
  "module": "auth",
  "description": "Email verification dengan OTP (valid 15 menit) saat registrasi",
  "scope": {
    "inScope": ["Kirim OTP via email saat registrasi", "Validasi OTP 15 menit"],
    "outOfScope": ["OTP via SMS"]
  },
  "acceptanceCriteria": [

```

| Field | Rule |
|-------|------|
| `featureId` | must match `F-\d{3}` and equal the filename |
| `scope.inScope` | ≥ 1 item |
| `scope.outOfScope` | may be empty, never omitted |
| `acceptanceCriteria` | ≥ 1; ids `AC1`, `AC2`, …; `done` starts `false`; each criterion concrete and testable |
| `dependsOn` | feature ids, consistent with the registry |
| `source` | brief file (+ optional `lines`) the feature came from |

### Common mistakes — DO NOT make these

| Wrong | Correct |
|-------|---------|
| `{ "features": [...] }` | bare array `[...]` |
| `{ "questions": [...] }` | bare array `[...]` |
| `"lifecycle": "ready"` | `"lifecycle": "proposed"` |
| `"lifecycle": "blocked"` | `"lifecycle": "queued"` + `"blockedBy": ["Q1", ...]` (question ids) |
| `"blockedBy": ["F-002"]` | `"blockedBy": ["Q1"]` — blockedBy holds question ids, not feature ids (`dependsOn`/`blocks` are for feature ids) |
| `"question": "..."` | `"text": "..."` |
| `"blocksFeature": [...]` | `"unblocks": [...]` |
| `"timestamp": "..."` | `"ts": "..."` |
| `"action": "..."` | `"type": "..."` |
| `"source": "prd.md"` | `"provenance": { "file": "prd.md", "briefHash": "..." }` |
| `"status": "queued"` | `"lifecycle": "queued"` |
| `"id": "Q-001"` | `"id": "Q1"` |
| `"specLink": null` or `"specRef": null` | omit `specRef` entirely until a spec exists (schema rejects `null`) |
| `"humanOverride": null` | `"overrides": {}` |

## Style rules

- Present data, don't argue
- If multiple good options exist, show tradeoffs
- Never recommend a blocked feature
- Flag confidence level on every feature
- Include source traceability (file:line)
